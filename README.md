# Hyper Tic-Tac-Toe
Play tic-tac-toe but on N-dimensional space. For example: 2D, 3D, 4D, ... ND.
The minimal number of dimensions is one... but it's boring. Classic 2D board
is boring too. I prefer higher ones... like 3, 4 or 5. The highest possible 
limit depends on length of each dimension and system requirements... but 
playing in (really) high-dimensional space is very unreadable (masochists 
like it).
